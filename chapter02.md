2.1-1
* Using figure 2.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of INSERTION-SORT on the
  array A = [31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58]
  * Drew this out in my notebook; five arrow-notated drawings of the list lead us
    to a sixth with all elements in order: [26, 31, 41, 41, 58, 59]

2.1-2
* Rewrite the INSERTION-SORT procedure to sort into nonincreasing instead of
  non-decreasing order
  * Okay! See FILENAME
