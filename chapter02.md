2.1-1
* Using figure 2.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of INSERTION-SORT on the
  array A = [31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58]
  * Drew this out in my notebook; five arrow-notated drawings of the list lead us
    to a sixth with all elements in order: [26, 31, 41, 41, 58, 59]

2.1-2
* Rewrite the INSERTION-SORT procedure to sort into nonincreasing instead of
  non-decreasing order
  * Okay! See FILENAME

2.1-3 has its own file in exercises/

2.1-4:
* Consider the problem of adding two n-bit binary integers, stored in two
  n-element arrays A and B. The sum of the two integers should be stored in
  binary form in an (n + 1)-element array C. State the problem formally and write
  pseudocode for adding the two integers.
  * TODO: decode this
