// also pseudocode!
// This one's about a searching problem, given a sequence of n numbers A = [a1,
a2, ..., an], and a value v.
// should output an index i such that v = A[i] OR the special value NIL if v does
not appear in A. Because Reasons, CLRS 1-indexes, so I will too, here.

// hail linear search:

v...exists
for j = 1 to A.length
    checking = A[j]
    if checking = v
        return j
    elseif j = A.length
        return NIL


// TODO: Not yet sure how to translate this into a loop invariant; would like to later.
